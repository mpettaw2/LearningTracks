# Learning Tracks
Just a list of resources I found for learning programming/cs

##Programmer
Below is the Programmer's track. This should take about 6 months to a year. It's mostly focused on practicum:

###Math
[Pre-Algebra](www.khanacademy.com)
[Algebra I](www.khanacademy.com)
[Algebra II](www.khanacademy.com)
[Discrete Mathmatics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3Ffwsnad0k&list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz)

###Theory
[Engineering Thinking](https://www.edx.org/cs50)

Technically the courses below are Java programming courses but you will have to know this to do DS&A
[Intro to Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
[Intermediate Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-java)


DS&A
[Engineering Thinking](https://www.edx.org/cs50)
[Engineering Thinking](https://www.edx.org/cs50)
Data Structures and Algorithims I https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1
Data Structures and Algorithims II https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2

At this point you can practice on https://leetcode.com/ or https://www.topcoder.com. There are many other websites where you can practice.

###Programming Languages
Everyone should know git https://git-scm.com/

Backend Languages:
Python https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python (upgrade for python 3)
mySql https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql
php https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php
node.js https://www.freecodecamp.org/
bash (linux) https://www.datacamp.com
