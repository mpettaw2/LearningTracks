# Learning Tracks
Just a list of resources I found for learning programming/cs

## Programmer
Below is the Programmer's track. This should take about 6 months to a year. It's mostly focused on practicum:

### Math
* [Pre-Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org)
* [Algebra I](https://www.khanacademy.org)
* [Algebra II](https://www.khanacademy.org)
* [Discrete Mathmatics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3Ffwsnad0k&list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz)

### Theory
* [Engineering Thinking](https://www.edx.org/cs50)

Technically the courses below are Java programming courses but you will have to know this to do DS&A
* [Intro to Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
* [Intermediate Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-java)


#### DS&A
* [Data Structures and Algorithims I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
* [Data Structures and Algorithims II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
 
 

At this point you can practice on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) or [topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com). There are many other websites where you can practice on.

### Programming Languages
* Everyone should know [git](https://git-scm.com/)

#### Backend Languages:
* [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) (upgrade for python 3 if needed)
* [mySql](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)
* [php](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php)
* [node.js](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [bash (linux)](https://www.datacamp.com) 

#### Frontend languages:
* [Html/css/javascript](https://www.codecademy.com)
* [React](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101)
* [Frontend Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Just remember that this is limited, when you actually start working in development you will have to learn new things constantly. But this is a good start.
